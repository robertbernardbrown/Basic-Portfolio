                            Hi! Welcome to my page. Apologies if you were looking for Bobby Brown or Robert Brown (australian senator), but I'm not your guy. 
                        </p>
                        <p class = "p2">
                            However, if you're looking for a fullstack developer, I might be able to help you out. 
                        </p>
                        <p class = "p3">
                            I'm currently enrolled in a Fullstack certificate program at Georgia Tech and I'm looking to contribute to a company once I finish the course. I studied advertising in school and worked in digital advertising for 4 years
                            before making the switch over to programming, which I believe allows me to be much more hands-on and creative, as well as develop a technical skill. My experience in digital advertising means that I already have great experience
                            dicussing digital monetization and implementing tracking pixels and discussing different digital elements.
                        </p>
                        <p class = "p4">
                            While I'm not Bobby Brown, I'm not a bad singer and while I'm not an australian senator, I know how to make friends and listen to people. I'm also interested in staying active, whether it's running, gym, hiking, or surfing when I can make it
                            to a surf spot. Avid fan of dogs and the University of Georgia Bulldawgs (I'm aware there's a UGA-GT rivalry, yes). If you want to learn more, please contact me! I'd be happy to talk over the phone or over pizza.
                        </p>
